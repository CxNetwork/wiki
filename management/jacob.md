## Introduction
Jacob assists Ice Poseidon in various aspects of his everyday life. His duties include cleaning Ice's home, feeding Pepper, monitoring livestreams, and arranging stream snipes. Jacob is often mistaken as Ice's manager, but is actually an assistant and planner. It is accepted in the community that the best way to reach Ice Poseidon is to contact Jacob through Twitter.

## First appearance
Ice Poseidon announced during his 2017 EU trip that he had hired a "manager" to help him research and arrange livestreams while in Europe, as well as book restaurants to avoid callers. Although Ice went to ignore most of these plans, Jacob was the hired planner, and in June 2017, Jacob created the Reddit username /u/Jacob_Cx and Twitter handle @JacobK_Cx.

On July 31, 2017, [Jacob is introduced on stream](https://youtu.be/AnwbkwJhIa8?t=7m5) at Ice Poseidon's home. Initial community reception was positive, and Jacob is accepted into the Purple Army with open arms.


## Ice Poseidon NOT!
On August 16, 2017, Jacob creates the [Ice Poseidon NOT!](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiquG31jPsuJhLGqehnpag/) channel. Ice Poseidon NOT! is used to restream Ice Poseidon's livestream in order to have a single VOD despite disconnects and allow Jacob to apply overlays. Jacob's overlays would music and other elements to enhance the livestream. Jacob's efforts have been applauded by the community, and Ice Poseidon NOT! continues to be occasionally used.


## Now

Jacob remains as an assistant for Ice Poseidon and stays behind the scenes. He seldom appears on stream and when he does, he does not detract from any content.
