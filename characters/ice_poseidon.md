## Introduction
Paul "Ice Poseidon" Denino is the founder and owner of the Cx Network and Cx, LLC. Paul used to stream on Twitch, but after getting banned from Twitch in early 2017, he moved over to YouTube gaming - his Twitch channel of the same name had over 290,000 followers before getting banned.  

## Gaining fame, first appearence
He initially gained fame from his RuneScape livestreams. His first streams involved closing doors on RuneScape attempting to train the Prayer skill, intentionally slowing their experience gains for cheap laughs. He later gained fame from being a victim of the RuneScape clan ROT and being a key agitator of the "Emily faked cancer" meme. He was later known for staking gold, pranking players, playing "TriHard" song requests for the infamous Purple Army. This was the start of the Purple Army and what later has become the Cx Network.  

## The Purple Army
The Purple Army gets its name from his RuneScape clanchats name appearing as purple dots on the RS minimap.
