# TriHard

## About
TriHard is a Twitch Emote featuring the face of the Twitch streamer TriHex. It was first majorly used in Ice's community where his community donated to play "TriHard songs" (low-level racist songs) as a joke and everyone in the Twitch chat would spam the emote. Nowadays, the community spams TriHard whenever someone black appears on stream.

## Origin
In June 2012, Twitch streamer TriHex attended the Akon-23 anime convention in Dallas, Texas. There, he took a photograph with a woman while holding up a Dragon Ball wall scroll and making an excited face.
